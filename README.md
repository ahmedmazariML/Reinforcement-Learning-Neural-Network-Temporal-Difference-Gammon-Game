# Reinforcement-Learning-Neural-Network-Temporal-Difference-Gammon-Game
In this project, we study Backgammon game from a practical standpoint. We first, go through the theoretical tools in order
to get a better un- derstanding. Then, we examine an available code source implementing it. After that, we extend the code 
by adding our agent based neural network temporal difference, simulation driver to run sim- ulation and test the strength of 
a given player and other functionalities required to run it. Finally, we evaluate our results, discuss and put them into 
perspective.

# Our task 

1-Improve the code

2- Add a Neural Network Agent

Overall 500 lines of code were written by us, including significant changes in the original codebase.
